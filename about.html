            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Growing up with an undiagnosed autoimmune disease, I interacted with hospitals and insurance more often
                    than any 12-year-old should. These experiences opened my eyes to the inefficiencies in patient care and 
                    lit a spark in me to reform the “user experience” of healthcare, especially for patients with chronic 
                    conditions.</p>
                <p> Since then, I’ve explored every angle of the healthcare system that I could – wet lab life sciences 
                    research, health policy, digital health startups, patient advocacy groups, AI in healthcare, and 
                    public health. Of those, I am especially drawn to digital health startups for their direct, innovative 
                    impact on patients and policy/government for the ability to make large-scale, systemic changes – and I 
                    especially believe in the synergy between both of these worlds. </p>
                <p> I am now the Co-Founder of <a href="https://www.flairhealth.com">Flair Health</a>, which is a virtual platform offering nutrition counseling and 
                    health coaching services for patients with chronic conditions. I graduated from Stanford, where I studied 
                    Computer Science and Ethics and earned recognition as a Fulbright Scholar Semi-Finalist. I currently live 
                    in San Francisco and enjoy exploring coffee shops, learning new dance styles (salsa and bachata are my 
                    current favorites), and volunteering in my community. </p>
